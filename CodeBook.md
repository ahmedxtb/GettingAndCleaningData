## Raw data from "UCI HAR Dataset"

The raw data provided for the project were extracted from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The dataset included the following files "features_info.txt" which shows information about the variables used on the feature vector, "features.txt" which is a list of all features, "activity_labels.txt" which links the class labels with their activity name, "train/X_train.txt" the training set, "train/y_train.txt" the training labels, "test/X_test.txt" the test set, "test/y_test.txt" the test labels.

Each feature vector is a row on the text file and each feature is normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. The raw data provided consisted in 10299 observations of 561 variables.

## Cleaned data ("clean.data")

The data set obtained after merging, cleaning and labelling the raw data consists in a data frame named "raw.data" with 10299 observations of 69 variables.

Description of the variables.
* "Subject" : Factor variable (30 levels : 1..30) which lists the id of the subject.
* "Activity_Id" : Factor variable (6 levels : 1..6) which lists the id of the activity.
* "Activity" : Factor variable (6 levels : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) which lists the nature of the activity.
* "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z", "tBodyAcc-std()-X", "tBodyAcc-std()-Y", "tBodyAcc-std()-Z", "tGravityAcc-mean()-X", "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y", "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z", "tGravityAcc-std()-X", "tGravityAcc-std()-Y", "tGravityAcc-std()-Z", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z", "tBodyGyro-mean()-X", "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y", "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z", "tBodyGyro-std()-X", "tBodyGyro-std()-Y", "tBodyGyro-std()-Z", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z", "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "tBodyAccMag-std()", "tGravityAccMag-mean()", "tGravityAccMag-std()", "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()", "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()", "tBodyGyroMag-mean()", "tBodyGyroMag-std()", "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()", "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()", "fBodyAcc-mean()-X", "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z", "fBodyAcc-std()-X", "fBodyAcc-std()-Y", "fBodyAcc-std()-Z", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z", "fBodyGyro-mean()-X", "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y", "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z", "fBodyGyro-std()-X", "fBodyGyro-std()-Y", "fBodyGyro-std()-Z", "fBodyAccMag-mean()", "fBodyAccMag-std()", "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()", "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" : Numeric variables (normalized in [-1,1]) which lists the mean and standard deviation from the 561 variables of the raw data.

## Tidy data ("tidy.data")

The data set obtained after averaging each of the 69 variables from the cleaned data set for each activity and each subject consists in a data frame named "tidy.data" with 180 observations (30 subjects x 6 activities) of 68 variables.

Description of the variables.
* "Subject" : Factor variable (30 levels : 1..30) which lists the id of the subject.
* "Activity" : Factor variable (6 levels : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) which lists the nature of the activity.
* "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z", "tBodyAcc-std()-X", "tBodyAcc-std()-Y", "tBodyAcc-std()-Z", "tGravityAcc-mean()-X", "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y", "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z", "tGravityAcc-std()-X", "tGravityAcc-std()-Y", "tGravityAcc-std()-Z", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z", "tBodyGyro-mean()-X", "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y", "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z", "tBodyGyro-std()-X", "tBodyGyro-std()-Y", "tBodyGyro-std()-Z", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z", "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "tBodyAccMag-std()", "tGravityAccMag-mean()", "tGravityAccMag-std()", "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()", "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()", "tBodyGyroMag-mean()", "tBodyGyroMag-std()", "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()", "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()", "fBodyAcc-mean()-X", "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z", "fBodyAcc-std()-X", "fBodyAcc-std()-Y", "fBodyAcc-std()-Z", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z", "fBodyGyro-mean()-X", "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y", "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z", "fBodyGyro-std()-X", "fBodyGyro-std()-Y", "fBodyGyro-std()-Z", "fBodyAccMag-mean()", "fBodyAccMag-std()", "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()", "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" : Numeric variables (normalized in [-1,1]) which lists the average of the mean and standard deviation from the 561 variables of the raw data for each activity and each subject.
